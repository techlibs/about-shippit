# AI Engineer (Full-Stack)

**Location:** Remote  
**Type:** Full-time  
**Experience:** Mid-level (2-5 years)

## About Shippit

Shippit is an AI & Blockchain studio building the next generation of intelligent applications. We combine AI agents, knowledge graphs, and decentralized technologies to create products that think, learn, and scale. We move fast, ship daily, and believe AI should be a multiplier for everything we do.

**Website:** [shippit.app](https://shippit.app)

## The Role

We're looking for an AI Engineer who can build across the full stack. You'll use AI daily - not just to build AI features, but to accelerate your own development. From prototyping with LLMs to shipping production code, AI is your co-pilot.

This isn't a role where AI is an afterthought. You'll own end-to-end features that leverage agents, knowledge graphs, and intelligent interfaces. You'll also bring AI/blockchain curiosity and stay current with the rapidly evolving landscape.

## What You'll Do

- **Build and ship AI-powered features** from concept to production
- **Design intuitive interfaces** that make AI accessible to users
- **Integrate LLMs, agents, and knowledge systems** into user-facing products using frameworks like Zep and Neo4j
- **Develop real-time backend systems and APIs** with Convex and deploy on GCP infrastructure
- **Implement observability and monitoring** for AI systems using Langfuse and other tools
- **Own the full feature lifecycle** - design, build, test, deploy, and iterate
- **Use AI tools daily** to accelerate development and solve problems faster
- **Build and manage knowledge graphs** to power intelligent agent behaviors
- **Stay current** with AI/blockchain advances and bring new ideas to the team
- **Collaborate effectively** in an async, remote-first environment

## What We're Looking For

### Behavioral Traits (Critical)

- **Proactive and independent** - You don't wait to be told what to do
- **Research-oriented** - You stay current with AI news, tools, and techniques daily
- **High ownership** - You see problems and fix them without being asked
- **Strong communication** - You collaborate effectively in async, remote environments
- **Bias toward action** - You ship fast and iterate based on feedback
- **Low ego, high trust** - Best ideas win, regardless of who proposes them

### Technical Skills

- **2-5 years** of full-stack development experience
- **Strong TypeScript/JavaScript** and React skills
- **Modern frontend frameworks** - Next.js, React, or similar
- **Backend development** - Node.js, Python, or Go
- **API design** and real-time systems experience
- **Cloud infrastructure** - GCP, AWS, or Azure experience
- **Database experience** - SQL, NoSQL, or graph databases
- **Interest in AI/ML** - You've used LLMs, built with AI APIs, or integrated agents
- **Quality focus** - Writing tests, handling edge cases, building accessible UIs

## Nice to Have

- **Blockchain/Web3 development** - Smart contracts, DApps, or similar
- **AI/LLM production experience** - Fine-tuning, RAG, embeddings, or agent frameworks
- **Experience with specific tools** we use:
  - Convex for real-time serverless backend
  - Langfuse for LLM observability and tracing
  - Zep for knowledge graphs and semantic memory
  - Neo4j for graph database modeling
- **Experience with agent frameworks** or agentic workflows (Mastra, LangChain, CrewAI)
- **Open source contributions** or active participation in AI/dev communities
- **Former founder or early startup employee** who's built products from scratch
- **GCP experience** - Cloud Run, Cloud Functions, or similar services
- **Animation/design systems** experience

## Tech Stack

We use modern, AI-native tools that enable rapid development and production-grade reliability:

- **Frontend**: React, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: [Convex](https://www.convex.dev/) (real-time serverless database)
- **AI & Agents**: OpenAI, Anthropic, Agent frameworks (Mastra, LangChain)
- **Knowledge & Memory**: [Zep](https://www.getzep.com/) (GraphRAG, semantic memory), [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/) (graph database)
- **Observability**: [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com/) (LLM tracing & analytics)
- **Infrastructure**: [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/) (Cloud Run, Cloud Functions), Docker, CI/CD
- **Blockchain**: Smart contracts, Web3 integration, DApps

## How We Work

- **Small team, big ownership** - You'll have direct impact on product and architecture
- **AI-native development** - We use AI to build faster, not as a checkbox feature
- **Remote-first** - Work from anywhere, async communication, focus time protected
- **Ship daily** - We value velocity and iteration over perfection
- **Low ego, high trust** - Best ideas win, regardless of who proposes them
- **Stay current** - We expect you to research new AI/blockchain developments regularly

## Why Join Us

- **Join at the ground floor** of an AI & Blockchain studio building the future
- **Shape products** that will be used by millions worldwide
- **Work with cutting-edge technologies** - Latest AI models, knowledge graphs, real-time systems, blockchain
- **Modern stack** - Convex, Zep, Langfuse, Neo4j, GCP - technologies built for AI-first development
- **Direct influence** on technical direction and product decisions
- **Learn and grow** - Work alongside AI & blockchain experts who ship daily

## How to Apply

1. **Send your resume, GitHub, or portfolio** to our team
2. **Short intro call** with the team (30 min)
